## other info about myself

- I am a librarian by trade and as such have a great deal of experience with information and knowledge management, system administration and project management.  I have a passion for bringing out the good in all people and team coordination.  On a personal side I am a fitness fanatic and would love to someday incorporate my love for fitness to others and lead classes - there is just something about the physiological change in the brain that I feel can bring out the creativity in all participants.
