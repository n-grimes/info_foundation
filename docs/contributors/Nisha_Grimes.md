## why do I like to contribute to TF

I love helping to empower people with beneficial tools and information that enable them to positvely change their lives and create thriving communities. In return, the passion, creativity and drive of my fellow TF'ers empowers and inspires me to continuously strive towards self improvement, to break free of my own limiting beliefs and to create the world I wish to live in.
